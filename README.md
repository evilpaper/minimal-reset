# A Minimal CSS Reset

A minimal CSS reset for basic projects. Based on [A Modern CSS Reset](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/) by Andy Bell and the 
[Minimal CSS Reset](https://alligator.io/css/minimal-css-reset/) from Alligator. You can use either of them. I have cherry-picked the parts that works best for me.

## Installing / Getting started

Just copy the code and paste it on in the beginning of your CSS file. Or make it a stand alone file and import it.

A couple of words:
1. Box-sizing is set to border-box to ensure consistent and predictable sizing.
1. Lists will have no bullets by default.
1. Font size is 16px by default. Everything else can be specified in rem units.
1. Images are set to display: block since that is how I ususlly use them. Change if you want.
1. Input fields, buttons, textareas and select elements will inherit seletced font so you don't have to correct that separate.

## Licensing

Use it at your own will.
